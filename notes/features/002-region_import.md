# Region Import Feature

## Plan

We need to implement the import process for Region records, which define geographic regions in Morrowind with weather patterns, ambient sounds, and sleep disturbance creatures.

### Current State Analysis
- Parser exists: `Resdayn.Parser.Record.Region` with fields:
  - `id` (NAME)
  - `name` (FNAM)
  - `disturb_sleep_creature_id` (BNAM)
  - `weather` (WEAT) - weather probabilities for different conditions
  - `map_color` (CNAM) - color on map
  - `sounds` (SNAM) - array of sound entries with id and chance
- Empty Ash resource exists at `Resdayn.Codex.World.Region`
- No importer exists yet
- Import task has Region commented out
- Creature resource exists and can be referenced

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create Region Ash Resource**
   - Place in `World` domain alongside existing `Creature` resource
   - Define attributes matching parser output
   - Add `belongs_to` relationship to Creature for `disturb_sleep_creature_id`
   - Create embedded resource for sound list entries
   - Include standard Importable and Referencable extensions

2. **Create RegionSound Embedded Resource**
   - Embedded resource for sound entries in regions
   - Fields: `sound_id` (belongs_to Sound), `chance` (integer)
   - No separate table needed (embedded in Region)

3. **Create Weather Type**
   - Custom Ash type for weather probability map
   - Handle both 8-byte and 10-byte weather data formats

4. **Create Region Importer**
   - Follow existing importer pattern in `Resdayn.Importer.Record.Region`
   - Map parser data to resource attributes
   - Handle embedded sound list transformation
   - Handle create/update logic using `separate_for_import`

5. **Enable Import in ImportCodex Task**
   - Uncomment Region from the import list
   - Add to the execution order in `run_importer/2`

### Resource Design
- Primary key: `id` (string)
- Foreign key: `disturb_sleep_creature_id` (references Creature resource)
- Fields: `name` (string), `weather` (custom type), `map_color` (color type), `sounds` (array of embedded RegionSound)
- Domain: `Resdayn.Codex.World`

### Dependencies
- Creature resource (already exists)
- Sound resource (already exists)
- Color type (already exists)

This feature will enable importing region definitions with weather patterns and ambient sounds from game data files.

## Log

### Implementation Progress

1. **Created RegionSound Embedded Resource** ✅
   - Added `Resdayn.Codex.World.Region.RegionSound` as embedded resource
   - Fields: `sound_id` (belongs_to Sound), `chance` (integer 0-255)
   - Proper action definitions with explicit accept lists
   - No separate database table (embedded in Region)

2. **Created Weather Custom Type** ✅
   - Added `Resdayn.Codex.World.Region.Weather` custom Ash type
   - Handles both 8-byte and 10-byte weather data formats from parser
   - Validates all weather values are integers 0-255
   - Provides default values for all weather types

3. **Created Region Ash Resource** ✅
   - Added `Resdayn.Codex.World.Region` with proper attributes
   - Attributes: `id`, `name`, `weather`, `map_color`, `sounds` array
   - Belongs_to relationship to CreatureLevelledList (not Creature as initially planned)
   - Uses Importable extension only (no Referencable per instructions)

4. **Updated World Domain** ✅
   - Added Region to `Resdayn.Codex.World` domain resources

5. **Created Region Importer** ✅
   - Implemented `Resdayn.Importer.Record.Region`
   - Fixed sound transformation to handle nested arrays from parser
   - Maps parser data: `id`, `name`, `weather`, `map_color`, `sounds`, `disturb_sleep_creature_id`
   - Uses standard `separate_for_import` pattern for create/update logic

6. **Fixed Foreign Key Reference** ✅
   - Discovered `disturb_sleep_creature_id` references CreatureLevelledList, not Creature
   - Updated relationship to reference correct resource
   - Reordered imports so Region comes after all dependencies

7. **Database Migration** ✅
   - Generated migration: `20250529170102_update_region_creature_reference.exs`
   - Had to rollback and regenerate after fixing foreign key reference
   - Created `regions` table with proper schema and foreign key constraints
   - Migration applied successfully

### Technical Discoveries

- **Sleep Creature IDs are Levelled Lists**: All `disturb_sleep_creature_id` values reference CreatureLevelledList records, not individual Creatures
- **Sound Data Structure**: Parser returns sounds as nested arrays that needed flattening
- **Weather Data Formats**: Parser handles both 8-byte (older) and 10-byte (newer) weather data

### Testing Results ✅

**Import Test:**
- Successfully imported 9 Region records from Morrowind.esm
- All records processed without errors
- Foreign key constraints properly enforced

**Sample Data Verification:**
```
Region: Sheogorad (Sheogorad Region)
  Weather: %{"ash" => 0, "blight" => 0, "blizzard" => 0, "clear" => 15, "cloudy" => 40, "foggy" => 10, "overcast" => 15, "rain" => 10, "snow" => 0, "thunder" => 10}
  Map Color: #801A99
  Sounds: 12 entries
  Sleep Creature: ex_sheogorad_sleep
```

**Relationship Testing:**
- CreatureLevelledList relationships work correctly
- Embedded RegionSound relationships to Sound records work correctly
- Complex data types (Weather, Color) properly stored and retrieved
- Embedded sound arrays correctly loaded with related Sound records

**No Warnings or Errors:**
- All compilation successful
- All database constraints satisfied
- All relationships functional
- Import process complete without issues

## Conclusion

The Region import feature has been successfully implemented and tested. All components are working correctly:

✅ **Ash Resource**: Proper domain placement, custom types, embedded resources, and relationships  
✅ **Database Schema**: Migration applied, table created with correct foreign key constraints  
✅ **Import Process**: Parser integration, data transformation, nested array handling  
✅ **Relationships**: CreatureLevelledList and Sound references working correctly  
✅ **Data Quality**: 9 records imported successfully with complex embedded data  
✅ **No Warnings/Errors**: Complete implementation without compilation or runtime issues  

The feature follows established project patterns and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase. Region records can now be imported from game data files with their weather patterns, ambient sounds, and sleep disturbance creature references.

**Key Technical Achievements:**
- Created custom Weather type for complex weather probability data
- Implemented embedded RegionSound resources with proper Sound relationships  
- Correctly identified and handled CreatureLevelledList foreign key references
- Successfully transformed nested array data structures from parser
- Maintained referential integrity with dependency ordering in import process
